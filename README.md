# Deep-Learning-Models-4-Muscle-Bones-Segmentation


This repo (will) contain code for our paper which investigated and applied six deep learning models to segment individual lower leg muscles and bones from MRI scans of children with and without cerebral palsy.


The investigated models were: UNet, UNet++, 3D UNet, VNet, H-DenseUNet, and an HybridUNet which is an in-house model inspired by H-DenseUNet. The code is currently under active refactoring for release. If you are really eager to learn more about our project please reach out to me at jiayi.zhu3@unsw.edu.au. Early access to our code will be granted upon reasonable request.


To learn more about UNet check out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). The paper where UNet++ was proposed can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05074), 3D UNet and VNet were proposed in [3D UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650) and in [VNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797), Finally, H-DenseUNet was proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07330).
